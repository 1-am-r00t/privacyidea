   OTP : OTP
   OTP Value : OTP
   OTP Part: OTP
        A one-time password, which is generated by some mathematical algorithm, usually HMAC,
        based on a seed. The term OTP value is used frequently by privacyIDEA to distinguish
        the OTP from the :term:`OTP PIN`.

   OTP PIN: OTP PIN
   Static Part: OTP PIN
        The OTP PIN is the secret password with which the user authenticates against privacyIDEA.
        The policy action :ref:`otppin_policy` sets the type of password. With this
        password privacyIDEA will identify the tokens for which further actions are taken
        (trigger a challenge or check a given :term:`OTP`).
   Seed
        The seed is a secret which is shared between the privacyIDEA server and the client.
        One-time passwords are calculated based on the seed.

   Count
        The token property ``count`` in privacyIDEA is used to calculate the :term:`OTP` value
        using the HMAC-type algorithms HOTP or TOTP.

   OTP Value
        A one-time password, which is generated by some mathematical algorithm, usually HMAC,
        based on a seed. The term OTP value is used frequently by privacyIDEA to distinguish
        the changing value from the :term:`OTP PIN`.
        In terms of two factor authentication the OTP Value is actually the 2nd factor,
        the possion factor, since it is usually only possible to calculage, if the user
        is in the possession of the smartphone app or a hardware token. The OTP Value is calculated
        using the secret cryptographic :term:`Seed`.

   OTP PIN
        The OTP PIN is the secret password with which the user authenticates against privacyIDEA.
        The policy action :ref:`otppin_policy` sets the type of password. With this
        password privacyIDEA will identify the tokens for which further actions are taken
        (trigger a challenge or check a given :term:`OTP Value`).
        In terms of two factor authentication the OTP PIN is the first factor, the knowledge.

   Seed
        The seed is a cryptographic secret which is shared between the privacyIDEA server and the client
        like the smartphone app or a hardware token.
        One-time passwords are calculated based on the seed.

   Count
   Counter
        The token property ``count`` in privacyIDEA is used to calculate the :term:`OTP Value`
        using the HMAC-type algorithms HOTP or TOTP.

   WebUI
        privacyIDEA comes with a web-based user interface which is used to manage and
        configure the privacyIDEA server.

        It is also used a self-service portal for the average user, who manages his own tokens.
        This section gives an overview on the interface and links the respective sections in the documentation.

   Time Step
        A TOTP token can have a timestep of 30/60 seconds. It can still be used, if this 30/60 seconds are over.
        Technically the timestep is the divider by which the seconds since 1.1.1970 (unix system time)
        are devided to calculate the OTP value.

        The ``timestep`` is different to the :term:`Time Window`.

   Time Window
        Timewindow in which the given OTP value is valid for authentication.
        ``Timestep and timewindow`` are completely similar to the ``counter and window`` of HOTP tokens.

   Revoked Token
        Tokens can be ``revoked``. Usually this means the token is ``disabled and locked``. A locked token can
        not be modified anymore. It can only be deleted. Certain token types like certificate may
        define special actions when revoking a token.

   Orphaned Token
        An orphaned token means, that it has a user assigned, but the user does not exist in the
        user store (anymore).

How to copy a resolver definition?
----------------------------------

Creating a user resolver can be a time consuming task. Especially an LDAP
resolver needs many parameters to be entered. Sometimes you need to create a
second resolver, that looks rather the same like the first resolver. So
copying or duplicating this resolver would be great.

You can create a similar second resolver by editing the exiting resolver and
entering a new resolver name. This will save this modified resolver
definition under this new name. Thus you have a resolver with the old name
and another one with the new name.

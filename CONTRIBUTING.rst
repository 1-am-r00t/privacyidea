You are welcome to contribute to privacyIDEA
============================================

There are different ways to contribute. Some of them should
be really easy.

Tell about it
-------------

You are using privacyIDEA in your network? Tell about it!
Write a blog post, tell your friends or simply twitter about it.
This will make privacyIDEA wider known and attract new contributors.

Tell us your ideas
------------------

If you have a *new idea* you may submit a feature request.
This should be a new idea that puts forward privacyIDEA and looks 
at some things from a new angle. 

Submit an issue and describe your idea in the best possible details.

https://github.com/privacyidea/privacyidea/issues

Translations
------------

If you have no programming skills you can still get involved
directly with the software by providing translations into 
different languages.

Test coverage
-------------

We have a rather high test coverage. But tests can always be
improved.

The tests are also split in three levels: database, library and API.
Here you can find files that should get an improved test coverage.
Take a look at yellow and red files.

Develop
-------

And of course you can contribute code! Starting with fixings in the
code or even implementations of new concepts.
Take a look at the issues. Maybe you can find something, you
would like to start with?
If you are sending a pull request, please note the following:

 * often it is a good idea to **create an issue**, that describes
   you problem or idea, which you want to solve with your
   pull request.
 * in your pull request refer to the issue.
 * describe your changes in the commit message.
 * At the beginning of the file, add the date, your name,
   your email address and a description of what you 
   changed in the file!

Thanks a lot for contributing to privacyIDEA!

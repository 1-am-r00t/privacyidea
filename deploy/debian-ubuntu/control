Description: two-factor authentication system e.g. for OTP devices
 privacyIDEA: identity, multifactor authentication, authorization.
 This package contains the python module for privacyIDEA. If you want
 to run it in a productive webserver you might want to install
 privacyidea-nginx or privacyidea-apache2.
 privacyIDEA is an open solution for strong two-factor authentication.
 privacyIDEA aims to not bind you to any decision of the authentication protocol 
 or it does not dictate you where your user information should be stored. 
 This is achieved by its totally modular architecture.
 privacyIDEA is not only open as far as its modular architecture is concerned. 
 But privacyIDEA is completely licensed under the AGPLv3.

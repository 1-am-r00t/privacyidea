This is the library for retrieving machines and adding tokens and
applications to machines.

This module is tested in tests/test_lib_machines.py.

It depends on the database model models.py and on the machineresolver
lib/machineresolver.py, so this can be tested standalone without realms,
tokens and webservice!
